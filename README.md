# Pinboard

This is a simple application for conference, where the host allows users to submit questions anonymously. 

Anyone with the link can see all the questions submitted, and like the question. Each question has a like counter, which will increase by 1 with each like by other participants.

The host can mark the question as answered, and it will be greyed out and move to the bottom. 
The host can also delete any questions, and download the list of questions as a text file.
